# How are hearts and arrows patterns created?

"Hearts and Arrows Diamonds" are widely recognized as the very best. Super ideal proportions and incredible optical precision produce a pattern of 8 hearts and 8 arrows when the diamond is viewed while unmounted through a special scope.

People often ask me how hearts and arrows diamonds are produced. Creating a crisp and complete pattern of hearts and arrows requires a great deal of skill and planning.

As you can see by the illustration provided above, the heart shape reflection of light is created when light reflecting off of the pavilion main facet, splits apart as it travels across the stone, and reflects on to the lower girdle facet located opposite of it.

While this might seem simple, every facet polished on the surface of the diamond must be indexed perfectly. All of the facets per section need to be the same size and shape. The facets of the diamond must be perfectly aligned from the perspective of 360 degrees.
